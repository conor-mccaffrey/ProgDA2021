    "For this project, I have decided to merge both my personal interests and professional career to date. I currently am employed in the Pharmaceutical sector and have a keen interest in Business/Analytics (hence the reason for enrolling in this H.Dip!). In light of this, I want to explore something that may seem a bit 'left-field' and for which I am not sure there will even be much data available but I believe it is the knowledge gained as opposed to the actual end-result that will have the most benefit for me in this project and my career. I want to explore any possible correlation between a company's Research and Development (hereafter denoted as '<b>R&D</b>') spending and their annual profit. I will take account of the number of products a company has for sale also in our estimations also and see if that correlates to overall profits in any way.\n",

    "\n",
    "This would, in itself, make for an interesting project but I want to keep this investigation focussed solely on R&D and profit and if there is any correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some points I would like to hopefully investigate in the generation of the data set are:\n",
    "- R&D spend of top pharmaceutical companies \n",
    "- Number of products sold by companies with high R&D spend\n",
    "- Profit margin for companies with high R&D spend\n",
    "- Employee size of companies\n",
    "- Different treatment areas that account for majority of R&D spend (i.e. Oncology, Cardiovascular, Metabolic, Neurodegenerative conditions)\n",
    "\n",

    "As part of the requirements for this project, we must generate a synthetic dataset that closely resembles our research as much as possible. So, the obvious question is: <u>What is a synthetic dataset?</u>. At it's most basic, synthetic data is data generated algorithmically, as opposed to generated by collection of real-life data (6). One of the main uses for the generation of synthetic datasets is in Machine Learning (ML) (6). Advantages of incorporating the use of synthetic datasets come in the relatively cheap production costs and also the safety regarding data privacy (7). Despite the relatively recent emergence of synthetic datasets, there are already numerous companies which specialise sole in the generation of synthetic datasets such as [iData](https://intelligent-ds.com/idataquality/idata-data-quality-management/), [Sarus Technologies](https://sarus.tech/) and [BetterData](https://www.betterdata.ai/). As can be seen from the below graph, the generation of synthetic is only going to exponentially increase over time (7).\n",

    "An interesting aspect of this project will be type of Pharmaceutical companies listed in our tables for most profit. From this table, we might be able to divulge which specific treatment areas seem to generate the most profit for companies. Immediately, some areas come to mind: oncology treatments, 'ultra-rare' disease treatments. For example, 'Zolgensma', developed by Novartis, is a one-time treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (degeneration of muscle) that costs €1,877,746 (11). This product is a direct competitor to 'Spinzara', produced by Biogen, which also is currently the tenth most expensive treatment with an annual cost of €331,367 (11). The difference between the treatments is that 'Spinzara' is a multiple-dose treatment as opposed to 'Zolgensma' which is a single-dose treatment. This gives you a range of drug costs for these high-end treatments. \n",

    "Different treatment areas can also be examined to see how they can contribute to a company's profit margin. According to [The cost of cancer in Europe 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959804920300265/), almost €32 billion was spent in Europe on cancer-related drug treatments in 2018. In 2020, almost €246 billion was spent in the USA on cancer related care (12). Neurological disorders also account for a large proportion of health spending. According to a 2019 [EU-commissioned report](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/IDAN/2019/631045/IPOL_IDA(2019)631045_EN.pdf), almost €800 billion annually is spent on direct- and indirect-care for neurological disorders in the EU (13). Roughly the same figure is spent in the USA on neurological disorder care (14).These are huge amounts of money being spent on the incidence of treatments that are each increasing globally (15,16). Naturally, with such huge amounts of money being spent on treatments for these types of diseases, vasts sums of money are spent on developing effective treatments.\n",

The below graph outlines the spend from 2012-2020 by the Irish Government on certain treatment areas. Similar to the theme conveyed above, we can see a dramatically increasing annual spend on anti-cancer treatments. Expenditure on cancer treatments has increased 15% annually over this period despite a patient growth in this area of 5% (26). This appears to suggests the increasing spend on anti-cancer treatments is to cover higher costs, as opposed to higher patient numbers. It is also worth noting the graudal increase in spend for Multiple Sclerosis treatment, a neurological disorder affecting the nerves (26,27). \n",

    "Research and Development (R&D) is considered to be the work carried out by a company in order to develop new products which can eventually add to the overall net profit of a company (18). The main reason for a company to undertake R&D is to develop new products, add to profit and therefore remain dominant/competitive in a certain field. If a company does not engage in effective R&D, it may fall behind competitors or need to depend on mergers/acquisitions to grow and add to profit (18). The basic premise of the R&D department is to develop new products and ensure they generate income for their company (19). This is done through product testing and use of data to determine if a product meets a certain need/niche within the market. R&D work can consist of detailed studies/projects determining the efficacy of a certain product/process. An essential parameter here is to ensure the product satisfies all market and regulatory requirements regarding safety (19). Another function of the R&D department is a sanity check, ensuring an existing product still meets a certain market requirement and still outperforms competitor equivalents. If this is not the case, the R&D department would be responsible for making the required product alteration to improve product performence. This may also lead to changes in the manufacture of the product (19)."

    "- <b> Basic Research</b>, which is high-level research with the overall aim to gain a more thorough understanding of a concept/process (18). Due to the wide-ranging scope of this research, high levels of profits may not be realised from this work. However, work carried out under basic research may then lead to more applied research.\n",

    "It is quite clear that an effective R&D department can generate large returns for a company and lead to the formation of new products and leaner manufacturing processes. However, there are also other advantages to carrying out R&D projects. In Ireland, specifically, there a tax credit to be gained for companies that perform R&D studies in Ireland and the European Economic Area (21). There is a 25% tax credit available for companies that engage in R&D projects which is used to reduce a company's payable Corporation Tax (22). Another advantage is the goodwill factor of publishing pertinent information to the public and also collaborating with academic institutions in order to raise awareness of a company's brand. This last point is quite prominent within the scientific field through the use of 'placements' for students who will work with a company (on a research project, perhaps exploring a certain product) for a defined period of time. \n",
